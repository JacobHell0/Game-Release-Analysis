Below is a small portion of the beginning of the Jupyter notebook, I encourage you to at least go through and look at the interesting graphics and the conclusions.

# Introduction
In this report, the dataset to look at is a dataset of ign.com reviews on video games. Ign is a very popular gaming website for reviewing video games. Ign is generally favorable among consumers and consumers generally agree on the reviews published by the ign network. They have reviewed almost every video game that has come out in the past decade. This report aims to analyze the relationship of different data such as the genre, month, and platform a game was released on vs how well the game performed based on the reviews. If you were a game studio, does the time you release your game impact how well it does? This analysis will answer three questions:

1. Does the genre of game impact how well the reviews are?
2. Does the month in which the game was released impact how good the game was rated?
3. Does the game being released on console, impact it's reviews
